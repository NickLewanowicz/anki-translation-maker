Server Side Public License
Version 1, October 16, 2018

The Server Side Public License (the "License") is a copyleft license that, unlike the GPL, requires users who make the functionality of the licensed work available to third parties as a service to make the service source code available under this same license.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense, and distribute the Original Work and such Derivative Works, with or without Modifications, in Source or Object form.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Original Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Original Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.

You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Original Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without Modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

(a) You must give any other recipients of the Original Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and

(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Original Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

(d) If the Original Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License.

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Original Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Original Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Original Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

You may add Your own copyright notice to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Original Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

13. Use as a Service.

If you make the functionality of the Original Work or modified version available to third parties as a service, you must make the Service Source Code available via network download to everyone at no charge, under the terms of this License. Making the functionality available to third parties as a service includes, without limitation, enabling third parties to interact with the functionality remotely through a computer network, offering a service the value of which entirely or primarily derives from the value of the Original Work or modified version, or offering a service that accomplishes for users the primary purpose of the Original Work or modified version.

"Service Source Code" means all the source code needed to make, run, and maintain the service, including all the source code for all services used to make the functionality available to third parties and all the source code for all dependencies, including system dependencies.

For clarity, Service Source Code does not include source code for services that do not directly serve the functionality to users and that are not part of the value proposition of the service.

DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY: THE ORIGINAL WORK IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE ORIGINAL WORK IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE ORIGINAL WORK PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE LICENSOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY: UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO ANYONE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER ARISING AS A RESULT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE ORIGINAL WORK INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM LICENSOR'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
